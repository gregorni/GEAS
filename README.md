# GEAS
** A mobile sensor platform for big scale collection of geodata. **

The Geodata Acquisition and Analysis System aims to develop a mobile system that enables large-scale and efficient collection of geodata. The collected data should be presented in a clear and insightful way to draw conclusions for sustainable and health-oriented urban development optimization.

One successful application of this system was a measurement campaign on the topic of fine particle pollution in the Karlsruhe area. For this purpose, a measurement module based on a Raspberry Pi was mounted on bicycles to systematically capture measurement data of the city area of Karlsruhe. The data collected by the measurement module were stored in a database and processed by a Python program. The results were visualized using GIS software.

The geodata acquisition and analysis system has multiple use cases and enables decision-making based on sound data for sustainable and health-oriented urban development.
